# POWERBI-Papollo-Hospital-Project

### Overview
The **Papollo Hospital Project** is a Power BI-based data analytics project focused on providing comprehensive insights into hospital operations. The project visualizes key aspects of patient management, bed occupancy, doctor feedback, diagnosis trends, and financials, including billing and insurance comparisons.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of patient records with the following columns:

- **Patient_ID**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Admit_Date**: Date of patient admission.
- **Discharge_Date**: Date of patient discharge.
- **Diagnosis**: Type of medical condition diagnosed.
- **Bed_Occupancy**: Type of bed occupied (Private, General, ICU).
- **Test**: Diagnostic tests conducted (e.g., CT Scan, MRI, X-ray).
- **Doctor**: Name of the attending doctor.
- **Followup Date**: Scheduled follow-up date.
- **Feedback**: Patient's feedback score for the attending doctor.
- **Billing Amount**: Total billing amount for the patient.
- **Health Insurance Amount**: Amount covered by health insurance.

### Project Requirements & Key Insights

1. **Patient Information**:
   - Visualized patient details based on their unique Patient_ID.

2. **Billing Information**:
   - Displayed billing and insurance amount comparisons for various tests.

3. **Bed Occupancy Breakdown**:
   - Analyzed occupancy for Private, General, and ICU beds.

4. **Doctor Feedback**:
   - Aggregated feedback scores for doctors based on patient reviews.

5. **Diagnosis-wise Statistics**:
   - Provided breakdown of diagnosis frequency (e.g., Viral Infection, Flu, Malaria).

6. **Billing vs Insurance**:
   - Compared billing amounts with insurance coverage for various tests and procedures.

### Visualizations

The dashboard includes:

- **Bed Occupancy**: Bar chart showing the count of patients in different bed categories.
- **Doctor Feedback**: Donut chart summarizing the volume of feedback for each doctor.
- **Diagnosis-wise Patient Count**: Horizontal bar chart displaying the frequency of different diagnoses.
- **Billing vs Insurance**: Line chart comparing billing and insurance amounts for various tests.

### Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For creating the dashboard and visualizations.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and processed data in Power BI for effective visualization.
